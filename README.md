# py4viz2022
The repository for hackaton project for the course.

Creators: Dasha Morozova, Polina Karpova and Asya Alekseeva.

There are 3 code files, because we wrote each parts individually, and it was hard to compile all of them in a single file. Also it turned out that we used slightly different datasets (there are two of them), so we attach them all. They mostly differ only in columns titles, other than that they seem to be identical.
